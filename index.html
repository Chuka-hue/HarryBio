                    <strong>First Episode: </strong> In my Category Buying Analyst role with Studio Retail Limited, my manager gave me an important, time-sensitive task to complete. My task was to liase with some suppliers and ensure that selection and product set up are completed before launch date for their products. It was my responsibility to make sure the task was finished before the product go-live date. 
                    I conducted competition shopping in order to ensure correct market benchmarking for the item. I initiated both direct and indirect communication with the supplier through face to face meeting, virtual meeting on Microsoft Teams and electronic messaging.
                    At the same time, I collaborated with the audit, finance and sales team to make sure that everyone's critical path was aligned. 
                    The suppliers had been very time-consuming to deal with during the licensing process. So, I remained assertive and explained to them that without their cooperation I might not be able to guarantee their successfully product launch with us. Hence, they start taking our deal more serious and making things much easier.
                    Finally, I finished my task a day before the live date and submitted the deliverables for my manager to approve. I was excited that the product was successfully launched on the live date and gained a percentage margin of 11% on the first week of trading. The result came out fine for the supplier as well and they kept bringing strategic deals to my company.  Afterwards my skills and confidence in managing stakeholders and business partners improved.

                    <strong>Second Episode: </strong>During my final year project in the university, I faced a financial
                    challenge to carry out my research project. My project work required me to travel and conduct
                    surveys for data analysis and I don’t have money to complete it. So I decided to do some minor
                    jobs to raise money and complete my research. Luckily, with the support of my friend, the amount I was able to raise within that period helped me and my project work was completed successfully and landed an internship role.

                    <strong>Third Episode: </strong>The most difficult issue I faced is after I finished from Internship during the COVID-19 pandemic. I searched for a job but was unable to secure one. I felt very bad at that moment so I
                    decided do unskilled jobs. I was able to realise some money and, I used the money to study for another degree company and I got a job after my studies.
